# Advanced-Computer-Architecture

## Objective of this repo
Using different techniques:
1. To exploit Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) statically and dynamically. 
1. To addresses some aspects of the design of domain-specific accelerators. 
1. To explores security challenges based on microarchitectural features and hardware isolation techniques.
