# Advanced-Computer-Architecture

## Objective of this repo
Using different computer architecture techniques:
1. To exploit Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) statically and dynamically. 
1. To addresses some aspects of the design of domain-specific accelerators. 
1. To explores security challenges based on microarchitectural features and hardware isolation techniques.

## Main works
1. A Cycle-by-Cycle Simulator of an Out-of-Order Processor [1] (implemented by Python).
2. A Cycle-by-Cycle Scheduler for a VLIW Processor [2-3] (implemented by Python).
3. High-level Synthesis. (implemented by C)
