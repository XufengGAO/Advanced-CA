# Advanced-Computer-Architecture

## Objective of this repo
Using different techniques:
1. To exploit Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) statically and dynamically. 
1. To addresses some aspects of the design of domain-specific accelerators. 
1. To explores security challenges based on microarchitectural features and hardware isolation techniques.

## Main works
1. A Cycle-by-Cycle Simulator of an Out-of-Order Processor [1] (implemented by Python).

## Reference
1. [MIPS R10000 Superscalar Microprocessor](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=491460).
